# How to make beliefs - When to believe what someone else believes

- We can't do the scientific proofs for everything we believe in life
  - Too much, everything that goes into understanding how and why the internet works would take too long
  - Example? Step through proofs for something a bit simplier
- We have to choose some sources we assign a high liklihood of being correct, without doing the experiments ourselves
- How to choose
  - When you can see the result of a belief and it matches up, that's evidence towards it being correct. Even without doing experiments to scientifically proove it's the correct cause. But not always
  - Vet the reliability and robustness of sources,
    - Do they admit when wrong
    - Do they provide proofs for a variety of different agendas (trying to ensure they're not politically or personally motivated)
- Pitfalls
  - Just choosing sources you want to believe

- Can't do the experiments to proove everything you need to rely on
- So need to figure out who to trust as likely being right (scientists, philosophers, entrepreneurs, friends, neighbours etc)
- Without choosing people who are biased or help reinforce politically or personal bias in our own beliefs
- Look at peoples methods and understand what is meant by scientific method and proof. If they follow these practices, publish the methods and other people replicate the results. Probability in belief increases
- We're not going to look up this for a lot of what we read, hear or think about. So then what?
  - Take a min to think, what do I know and how do I know it. If it's just from random conversation and the news, think in terms of probabilities how likely is it that those sources are accurate
- If you knew someone to be a perfect rationalist, as a rationalist yourself you would believe everything they said, without needing to check yourself. This is not the case, but the principle applies for assigning a probability to it. How rational do I think the people with these beliefs are?
- Lot's of people believing something can be a very weak proof, however the general public are not normally very good rationalists and very susceptable to the news and social media. Which is not a great space for rationality.
- Find groups which have a high level of rationality
- Other resources
  - Bias
  - Less wrong
