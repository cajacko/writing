# Balancing Alcohol, Drugs and Fun

There's no way around it, alcohol and drugs are super fun. Anything that can help you relax, have fun or open your mind sounds great in my books. I've developed some of my best (and often unusual) ideas when slightly drunk or high. And the impact of those ideas lasts way past the effects of the substance.

I see little difference between these kind of substances and gaming, bad foods, exercise, sex or anything else you do for pleasure. They can all give your great experiences, but can all come with downsides and have addictive tendencies. They just live on different locations on the spectrum.

- Gaming - 
- Bad foods - 
- Exercise - 
- Sex - 
- Alcohol - 
- Ecstacy - 

Becoming addicted to anything is bad. And the rode to becoming an addict can be a slippery one, so you want to stay way clear from the turning point.

But as long as you do stay clear and are very aware of the short and long term negative effects of any substance you take, keep experimenting.

For me, I've been very aware of the quantity of alcohol I drink. And take lots of measures to ensure I don't fall into addictive tendencies and am not dependant on alcohol:

- Tracking daily alcohol intake and viewing trends
- Social pressure 
- Pre committing
- Getting an online coach

So as long as I'm on the right side, I'd no longer stop drinking or taking drugs as I would stop gaming, having sex, watching superhero movies or building apps. (NOTE: Mix up the examples throughout the whole piece. Remember tone of voice)
