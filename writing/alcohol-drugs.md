# Balancing Alcohol, Drugs and Fun

There's no way around it, alcohol and drugs are super fun. Anything that can help you relax, have fun and open your mind sounds great in my books. I've developed some of my best ideas and philosophies when slightly drunk or high. (NOTE: Express the importance of ideas and ways of thinking persisting into sober states)

I see little difference between these and gaming, bad foods, exercise, sex or anything else you do for pleasure. They can all give your great experiences, but can all come with downsides and have addictive tendencies. Just in different amounts. (NOTE: Give a few bullet examples here?)

I reckon most of us can agree that becoming addicted to anything is bad. And the rode to becoming an addict can be a slippery one, so you want to stay way clear from the turning point.

But as long as you stay way clear from the point of addiction and are very aware of the short and long term negative effects of any substance you take, keep experimenting.

For me, I've been very aware of the quantity of alcohol I drink. And take lots of measures (NOTE: Would people want some examples of the measures?) to ensure I don't fall into addictive tendencies and am not dependant on alcohol. So as long as I'm on the right side, I'd no longer stop drinking or taking drugs as I would stop gaming, having sex, watching superhero movies or building apps. (NOTE: Mix up the examples throughout the whole piece. Remember tone of voice)
