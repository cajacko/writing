# Balancing Alcohol, Drugs and Fun

- Altering your mental state through substances can be fun and open your mind to new ideas and ways of thinking that persist after the actual effects have worn off
- Humans (mostly subconsciously) just try an optimise their own happiness. So how do we optimise substances
- Pretty much everything that has a physical effect on us could be considered a mind altering substance.
  - How warm you are
  - The lighting in a room
  - The smells around you
  - Eating when hungry
  - Sugar/fatty foods
  - The rush from exercise
  - Sex
  - Alcohol
  - Drugs
- But some have a more obvious effect and bigger side effects, that can have more addictive tendencies
- No addiction is desired

Axis

- How happy does the substance make you
- How addictive is the substance
- How bad does the substance make you feel when done in excess

Main points

- Everything is a drug, don't treat alcohol and narcotics differently to eating badly, exercise, masturbation, gaming etc. All do the same things but at different places on the scale
- It's good to take these in moderation, new experiences, fun, mind opening, creativity etc
- Don't let yourself become addicted/dependant to anything
- Keep taking substances that you find fun, as long as the short and long term downsides are worth it
- Make sure you are very aware of the short/long term effects
