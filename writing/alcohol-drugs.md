# Balancing Alcohol, Drugs and Fun

- Altering your mental state through substances can be fun and open your mind to new ideas and ways of thinking that persist after the actual effects have worn off
- Humans (mostly subconsciously) just try an optimise their own happiness. So how do we optimise substances
- Pretty much everything that has a physical effect on us could be considered a mind altering substance.
  - How warm you are
  - The lighting in a room
  - The smells around you
  - Eating when hungry
  - Sugar/fatty foods
  - The rush from exercise
  - Sex
  - Alcohol
  - Drugs
- But some have a more obvious effect and bigger side effects, that can have more addictive tendencies
- No addiction is desired

Axis

- How happy does the substance make you
- How addictive is the substance
- How bad does the substance make you feel when done in excess

Main points

- Everything is a drug, don't treat alcohol and narcotics differently to eating badly, exercise, masturbation, gaming etc. All do the same things but at different places on the scale
- It's good to take these in moderation, new experiences, fun, mind opening, creativity etc
- Don't let yourself become addicted/dependant to anything
- Keep taking substances that you find fun, as long as the short and long term downsides are worth it
- Make sure you are very aware of the short/long term effects

## Rules

- Rule 1: Never become addicted to anything
- Rule 2: Don't let yourself get close to becoming addicted to anything (as it's hard to pull away when close)
- Rule 3: Be very aware of the negative consequences both short and long
- Rule 4: Keep doing the things you find fun as long as the positive/negative balance is ok for you and you're not breaking the other rules

Whilst following these rules, I'd encourage people to take substances that open the world view, help their creativity, help you to relax etc. I've come up with ideas and motivations whilst a little drunk or high that have helped me out so much, even when I'm not in those states.

There's lots of fun and new experiences to be had. So don't go fully sober or not give a specific drug a go, as long as you're not risking those rules.
