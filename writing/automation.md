# Automate Everything

Write a note for Chris about what I want people to come away from this post feeling/learning:

Creating reminders and checklists for everything stops you forgetting stuff and frees you up to do what you want.

It's not your fault when you forget to turn up for board game night.

It's not your fault when you...

It's not your fault when you...

Well...it is your fault. But not for forgetting. Remembering mundane life admin tasks are not what humans were built for. But forgetting can cause lots of tiny negative experiences in our lives.

This is why we have machines. For doing the mundane things in life. Writing reminders for all of these tasks, that let you:

- Repeat reminders daily, weekly, monthly etc
- Snooze reminders until a more convenient date
- Add checklists so you can ensure you brought all your x to the y

You'll no longer forget to do anything.

Well...now you know, if you're still fucking up, I guess it is your fault.

I am terrible at remembering those tiny tasks in life that help (TODO: A funny). Without my phone and the cloud, I'm not sure I'd ever turn up to where I'm suppose to be, wash my bed as often as I should or (TODO: Funny)

Most of these are not massively important tasks, but failing to do them, turning up late or (TODO: Funny) can add lots of tiny negativity to my life. And Charlie don't like negativity.

So, as a programmer I wanted to offset as much as this responsibility to the machines as possible. No more forgetting regular life admin.

Organising your life is hard. Dozens of tiny things to do each month, week or day. A whole host of shit to remember anytime you go on holiday. People to arrange to see. Events to remember to go to.

Lots of tiny bullshit to remember to do for a well oiled life the way you want it. Problem is we suck at remembering stuff, or I do especially. So as a programmer I want to automate this life admin as much as possible.

That's why I have reminders and checklists for pretty much everything. Offsetting the mundane need to remember and process these tiny tasks to the machines that are much better at that than me.

I have reminders for:

- Seeing my friends
- Washing the bed
- Organising my notes
- Checking my calendar is up to date
- Doing my writing

And checklists for:

- Home stock take
- When going on holiday
- Ensuring we have everything for the dog

And oh so much more.

All these tiny tasks when added together take up a reasonable amount of mental capacity, when doing it yourself. Now I have more time and less stress of remembering what I should be doing or forgetting and suffering the consequences.

Here's some quick tips on setting up a good reminder/checklist practice and how I do it: (TODO: Inc Trello image and explain)

- You'll want to be able to "Repeat" reminders (daily, weekly, monthly or custom)
- The ability to snooze a reminder is super valuable
