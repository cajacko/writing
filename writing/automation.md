# Automate Everything

It's not your fault when you forget to turn up to board game night.

It's not your fault when you absentmindedly went 4 weeks without washing you bedding.

It's not your fault when you promised to get some more dog flea treatment, didn't, and 1 month later are living with an entire mob of fleas, lead by the big one called Klaus.

Well...it is your fault. But not for forgetting. Remembering mundane life admin tasks are not what humans were built for. This is why we have machines. So let's put them to work, even for the little things.

Tiny amounts of negativity everyday can build up to have a noticeable effect on your daily happiness. So it may seem insignificant and overkill, but automating these things can work.

So I create digital reminders and checklists for literally anything that would be annoying to forget or that I want to be doing in life, like:

- Cleaning the dishwasher filter
- Doing some writing everyday
- Organising to see friends I haven't seen in a while

For these reminders to be effective you need to have a system where you can:

- Repeat reminders (daily, weekly, monthly etc)
- Snooze Reminders (to a more convenient time)
- Add checklists to reminders (you'll never remember long lists)
- Add links and attachments to reminders
- Create static reminders (reminders that don't have a due date, but you can check at any time e.g. A checklist for when you're packing to go travelling)
- Get notifications when reminder are due (not necessarily needed if you develop a habit of checking frequently)

_I use Trello for this. You can check out **this post** on how I set it up._ (NOTE: Splitting, as this post is meant to be more emotional and inspirational, than step by step instructions)

With this in place you'll no longer forget to do anything.

Well now you know, and if you're still fucking up your life admin, I guess it is your fault.
