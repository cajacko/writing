# Automate Everything

Write a note for Chris about what I want people to come away from this post feeling/learning:

Creating reminders and checklists for everything stops you forgetting stuff and frees you up to do what you want.

Notes:

- Kinda want to emphasise how consistently forgetting this little tasks can build up the negativity in your life in a noticeable way. So this is important to solve. Otherwise it doesn't seem overly important.

It's not your fault when you forget to turn up for board game night.

It's not your fault when you...

It's not your fault when you...

Well...it is your fault. But not for forgetting. Remembering mundane life admin tasks are not what humans were built for. This is why we have machines. So let's make use of them, even for the little things.

I create digital reminders and checklists for literally anything that would be annoying to forget, like:

- Example 1
- Example 2
- Example 3

For these reminders to be effective you need to have a system where you can:

- Repeat reminders (daily, weekly, monthly etc)
- Snooze Reminders (to a more convenient time)
- Add checklists to reminders (you'll never remember long lists)
- Add links and attachments to reminders
- Create static reminders (reminders that don't have a due date, but you can check at any time e.g. A checklist for when you're packing to go travelling)
- Get notifications when reminder are due (not necessarily needed if you develop a habit of checking frequently)

_I use Trello for this. You can check out my post on how I set this up here._ (NOTE: Splitting, as this post is meant to be more emotional and inspirational, than step by step instructions)

With this in place you'll no longer forget to do anything.

Well now you know, and if you're still fucking up your life admin, I guess it is your fault.
