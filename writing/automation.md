# Automate Everything

- Bad memory, niche tasks, frequency and long checklists
- Improving yourself - frequent tasks to live happier
- Experimenting with habits - reminders, courses, coaches etc.
- Automating life - PA, scripts, reminders

My memory is shit. Without my phone I'm not sure I'd be able to function in normal society. (TODO: Examples. Forgetting events, getting back to people...).

But that's ok. As a programmer I'm a big fan of getting the machines to do as much for you as you can. And machines are much better at remembering stuff than you. So why not free yourself up and spend more time doing things a machine can't do. Like creative expression or having fun.

(NOTE: Point about no one remembering niche tasks, long lists or regular frequency)

I solve this by keeping reminders and checklists for everything. (TOOD: Examples)

Here are the key qualities of my reminder and checklist system:

- Repeated reminders
- Snooze reminders
- Visibility
- Ease to create a new one
- Checklists you can reset

I use Trello to manage all of this. (TODO: Describe in enough detail so others can do their own version)

The post is about forgetting things an duding reminders/checklists/calendars/alarms/notifications to solve that.

I love having nothing to do. No tasks or admin. Just time to dick about designing board games, developing weird app ideas or doodling pretty pictures.

We all have life admin to get done. (TODO: Examples)

And forgetting to do it can cause even more problems (NOTE: Needed to explain why we need reminders). (TODO: Examples)

As a programmer I spend most of my time trying to get the machines to do my job for me. So I've looked into how I can get the machines to make sure I never forget
So I've looked into how I can best get the machines to do my life admin and make sure I don't forget things. Which free's up my time for aforementioned dicking about.

The most important thing I do for this, is keep digital reminders and checklists for everything. (TODO: Examples)

The important aspects of these reminders are:

- I have reminders for pretty much everything in my life
- Some of these reminders repeat daily/weekly/monthly
- I can snooze these reminders to a more convenient time

Here's some bonus content on other ways I automate life admin and remembering:

- Calendar
- Scripts
- Personal Assistant

As a programmer I'm basically trying to automate myself out of a job. Getting the machines to do as much as possible so I can chill out and have a beer.

With the limited time we have, I try and get the machines to do as much for me in daily life as I can. This free's up my time for xxx (TODO: Silly thing)

Our time is super valuable, and we're constantly using it in tiny ways everyday. Processing and accessing our memory for things the machines can do for us much better than we can ourselves.

Our time is super valuable, I want to spend as much of it as possible doing fun stuff, not bullshit admin, chores or trying to remember what I'm meant to be doing.

And the machines do so a lot of tasks much better than we can. I'm shit at remembering stuff; the tasks I'm meant to do this week, what I need to take on holiday with me, what I've arranged to do etc. (TODO: start useful, last one funny).

Alas, there's still some things the machines can't do for us.
