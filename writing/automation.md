# Automate Everything

Write a note for Chris about what I want people to come away from this post feeling/learning:

Creating reminders and checklists for everything stops you forgetting stuff and frees you up to do what you want.

Organising your life is hard. Dozens of tiny things to do each month, week or day. A whole host of shit to remember anytime you go on holiday. People to arrange to see. Events to remember to go to.

Lots of tiny bullshit to remember to do for a well oiled life the way you want it. Problem is we suck at remembering stuff, or I do especially. So as a programmer I want to automate this life admin as much as possible.

That's why I have reminders and checklists for pretty much everything. Offsetting the mundane need to remember and process these tiny tasks to the machines that are much better at that than me.

I have reminders for:

- Seeing my friends
- Washing the bed
- Organising my notes
- Checking my calendar is up to date
- Doing my writing

And checklists for:

- Home stock take
- When going on holiday
- Ensuring we have everything for the dog

And oh so much more.

All these tiny tasks when added together take up a reasonable amount of mental capacity, when doing it yourself. Now I have more time and less stress of remembering what I should be doing or forgetting and suffering the consequences.

Here's some quick tips on setting up a good reminder/checklist practice and how I do it: (TODO: Inc Trello image and explain)

- You'll want to be able to "Repeat" reminders (daily, weekly, monthly or custom)
- The ability to snooze a reminder is super valuable
