As a programmer I'm basically trying to automate myself out of a job. Getting the machines to do as much as possible so I can chill out and have a beer.

With the limited time we have, I try and get the machines to do as much for me in daily life as I can. This free's up my time for xxx (TODO: Silly thing)

Our time is super valuable, and we're constantly using it in tiny ways everyday. Processing and accessing our memory for things the machines can do for us much better than we can ourselves.

Our time is super valuable, I want to spend as much of it as possible doing fun stuff, not bullshit admin, chores or trying to remember what I'm meant to be doing.

And the machines do so a lot of tasks much better than we can. I'm shit at remembering stuff; the tasks I'm meant to do this week, what I need to take on holiday with me, what I've arranged to do etc. (TODO: start useful, last one funny).

Alas, there's still some things the machines can't do for us.
