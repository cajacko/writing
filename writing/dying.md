# What I learned when I died

So I died the other day and it was very interesting. To clarify, I'm not actually writing this with my ghostly 👻 form in-between scaring the shit out of my friends 🙀. I had my first intense acid 🧪 trip where I was convinced that I was drowning, subsequently died and then snapped back to reality and decided to get some friends to look after me.

Putting aside the advisability to putting yourself in this situation (I'm not knocking 🚪 it, just be more sensible than me on my first time 😉, be safe and do your research), what I learnt from the entire affair (it wasn't all drowning 😛🌊) was super important for me and is still having an impact.

On the more positive side I've been curious to hallucinate for a while both to see what my mind would generate and how convincing the experience is, so I can better understand and think about perception and reality. Also, sounds fun 🥳. 

And on that side, it did not disappoint. I remember when it first kicked in and my senses (especially touch) became super sensitive and wonderful, mixed in with a literal sparkle/twinkling ✨ filter on top of everything I saw. I just burst out laughing 🎭. It was so magical 🧙‍♂️ and convincing, much more than I thought would be possible. I had thought that the realisation of knowing it wasn't real and the way I try to think rationally about things would cloud that experience a little. It certainly did not.

It gave me an intense appreciation 🥰 for everything around me, the present moment and the tiny things in life. Aspects of that have definitely persisted afterwards. In my analysis afterwards I realised that many of things I saw and felt during the experience revolved around subtle things in my life that I wasn't addressing as much as I should. Previously these things were in my head 🤯 but I just didn't really realise that I should be thinking about them more. The trip was basically a way of my mind highlighting to me what was important in my life.

On the flip side 🛹 there were some additional negative experiences and consequences that are a bit harder to see the pros 🤨 (although they are there). I've finally been introduced to a new friend, they're called Anxiety, and they are an absolute bitch. I've heard of this Anxiety character before, a few friends have met them and they've been in a few books I've read about. I met someone who I thought was like them once, but turned out that was an imposter 🕵️‍♂️. 

Now that I've definitely met anxiety it's interesting to finally have a bit of an understanding of what other's have been going through. The hardest part was realising that I couldn't think 🤔 my way out of anxiety. It just seemed to be an immovable emotional force that sucked when it turned up. I had it pretty intensely as the trip wore off and nowadays the triggers are minor things that make me for a split second think I may be back in the trip. It's not something that would actually put me into a psychotic break but is just the trigger for a short period of anxiety.

In some ways I'm kind of glad that I've been introduced to anxiety at a pretty stable time in my life. Where I have the time ⏰ and capacity to figure out how to best deal with it without having any dependants 🚸 that it would effect. It seems unlikely for someone living in a modern life to go the whole time without experiencing anxiety, so this is probably the best way it could have happened. And the biggest benefit is that it brings me a little step closer to sympathising with others. 

Overall I'm very glad for the whole experience, it was fun, opened my mind, showed me what was important and introduced me to an inevitable friend that I should learn to understand and deal with. Also I saw a child sized toad wearing a technicolored hat and sipping pond water through a super long straw. Not sure if that was a hallucination or really happened, who knows, the world is a strange and magical place 🧙‍♂️.
