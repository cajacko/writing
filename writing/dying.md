# What I learned when I died

- Notes from the first time I took acid and the effects afterwards
- Becoming less scared of death
- Having less trust in perception
- Finding out what anxiety is and how it can't be thought away as easily as I would have thought
- Understanding how fragile we are
- How beautiful, fascinating and wonderful life, creativity and senses can be
- Time dilation
- What was important
- Silly frog man

So I died the other day and it was very interesting. To clarify, I'm not actually writing this with my ghostly form in-between scaring the shit out of my friends (Add something even more ridiculous here). I had a very intense acid trip (for the first time) where I was convinced that I was drowning, subsequently died and then snapped back to reality and decided to get some friends to look after me.

Putting aside the advisability to putting yourself in this situation (I'm not knocking ðŸšª it, just be more sensible than me on my first time ðŸ˜‰), what I learnt from the entire affair (it wasn't all drowning ðŸ˜›ðŸŒŠ) was super important for me and is still having an impact.

On the more positive side.... (This section is about the fun stuff from tripping balls and the benefit afterwards)

However there was another side effect that is a bit harder to see the pros ðŸ¤¨. I've finally been introduced to a new friend, they're called Anxiety, and they are an absolute bitch. I've heard of this Anxiety character before, a few friends have met them and they've been in a few books I've read about. I met someone who I thought was like them once, but turned out that was an imposter. 

Now I've definitely met them... (point of this section is about being able to empathise better with others, experience something reasonably inevitable in life in a safe way that has less impact on others than if I had a family or something. And have the time to figure out ways of dealing with it. May need to explain about the reality and time loop stuff to explain why the anxiety is there. Death thing didn't really have as much of an impact, in fact that bit was probably a positive experience overall)

(Conclude with a sum up and some quick funny hints to some of the other stuff that happened: time dilation, seasons changing, frog man, baby legs)
