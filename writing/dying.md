# What I learned when I died

- Notes from the first time I took acid and the effects afterwards
- Becoming less scared of death
- Having less trust in perception
- Finding out what anxiety is and how it can't be thought away as easily as I would have thought
- Understanding how fragile we are
- How beautiful, fascinating and wonderful life, creativity and senses can be
- Time dilation
- What was important
- Silly frog man

So I died the other day and it was very interesting. To clarify, I'm not actually writing this with my ghostly 👻 form in-between scaring the shit out of my friends 🙀(Add something even more ridiculous here). I had a very intense acid 🧪 trip (for the first time) where I was convinced that I was drowning, subsequently died and then snapped back to reality and decided to get some friends to look after me.

Putting aside the advisability to putting yourself in this situation (I'm not knocking 🚪 it, just be more sensible than me on my first time 😉), what I learnt from the entire affair (it wasn't all drowning 😛🌊) was super important for me and is still having an impact.

On the more positive side I've been curious to hallucinate for a while both to see what my mind would generate and how convincing the experience is, so I can better understand and think about perception and reality. Also, sounds fun 🥳. 

And on that side, it did not disappoint. I remember when it first kicked in and my senses (especially touch) became super sensitive and wonderful, mixed in with a literal sparkle/twinkling ✨ filter on top of everything I saw. I just burst out laughing 🎭. It was so magical 🧙‍♂️ and convincing, much more than I thought would be possible. I had thought that the realisation of knowing it wasn't real and the way I try to think rationally about things would cloud that experience a little. It certainly did not.

It gave me an intense appreciation for everything around me, the present moment and the tiny things in life. Aspects of that have definitely persisted afterwards. In my analysis afterwards I realised that many of things I saw and felt during the experience revolved around subtle things in my life that I wasn't addressing as much as I should. Previously these things were in my head but I just didn't really realise that I should be thinking about them more. This helped me see the importance of them. (Word this better, be more concise)

On the flip side 🛹 there were some additional negative experiences and consequences that are a bit harder to see the pros 🤨 (although they are there). I've finally been introduced to a new friend, they're called Anxiety, and they are an absolute bitch. I've heard of this Anxiety character before, a few friends have met them and they've been in a few books I've read about. I met someone who I thought was like them once, but turned out that was an imposter. 

Now I've definitely met them... (point of this section is about being able to empathise better with others, experience something reasonably inevitable in life in a safe way that has less impact on others than if I had a family or something. And have the time to figure out ways of dealing with it. May need to explain about the reality and time loop stuff to explain why the anxiety is there. Death thing didn't really have as much of an impact, in fact that bit was probably a positive experience overall)

(Conclude with a sum up and some quick funny hints to some of the other stuff that happened: time dilation, seasons changing, frog man, baby legs)
