# Killing the Dog

- Working at home, so got a dog
- Completely underestimated the responsibility
- Took up so much mental effort, just being aware, worrying about training etc. Lack of sleep
- First time in my life I couldn't think properly. Grandma died of Alzheimers, made me think about the process of going through that, losing your mental faculties
- Scariest thing of my life, wanted to kill the dog
- Didn't as it meant so much to my wife, trying to think of accidents to organise. Couldn't think properly to do anything about it though
- Really glad now, learnt so much
  - Discipline
  - Responsibility
  - Not going to underestimate responsibility again
  - So glad did this before children
  - Now think about how I'd go about accepting if I start losing my mind, not sure properly yet. Meditation, slowing down and living in the moment helps

What my main points for other people, rather than being an interesting story?

- Don't underestimate responsibility
- Get a pet before children
- Discipline makes things so much easier
- Don't kill your pets, I wouldn't have learnt how to accept it
- Losing your mind sucks, meditation, simplicity and living in the moment are great helpers for accepting that this might happen to you and how to deal with it (probably)
