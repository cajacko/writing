# Killing the Dog - My new reason for practicing mindfulness

- Theory - Learning to slow down, and be present will have massive benefits when get old and thinking becomes harder. If you've made it a habit

---

Anyone else seriously wanted to kill their dog? Gone through a bunch of plans to make it seem like an accident?

- Serious
- Semi-serious
- Silly

Yeah, I did. Me and my partner decided to get a cute little malti-poo. A delightful ball of fluff and energy. I had gone freelance and was mainly working from home. What a great way to give me a little company and distraction from work.

Alas the first 2 weeks of being dog daddy was not great.

...

I learnt a whole bunch of other stuff from this process:

- The importance of discipline
- Finding ways to test big decisions before taking them (pets before children)
- What it's like to dramatically underestimate something, even when you thought you were already being pessimistic about the outcome

But none of those were as important to write about for me.

P.s. I love my dog üëç

- Working at home, so got a dog
- Completely underestimated the responsibility
- Took up so much mental effort, just being aware, worrying about training etc. Lack of sleep
- First time in my life I couldn't think properly. Grandma died of Alzheimers, made me think about the process of going through that, losing your mental faculties
- Scariest thing of my life, wanted to kill the dog
- Didn't as it meant so much to my wife, trying to think of accidents to organise. Couldn't think properly to do anything about it though
- Really glad now, learnt so much
  - Discipline
  - Responsibility
  - Not going to underestimate responsibility again
  - So glad did this before children
  - Now think about how I'd go about accepting if I start losing my mind, not sure properly yet. Meditation, slowing down and living in the moment helps

What my main points for other people, rather than being an interesting story?

- Don't underestimate responsibility
- Get a pet before children
- Discipline makes things so much easier
- Don't kill your pets, I wouldn't have learnt how to accept it
- Losing your mind sucks, meditation, simplicity and living in the moment are great helpers for accepting that this might happen to you and how to deal with it (probably)
