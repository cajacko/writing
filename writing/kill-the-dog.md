# Killing the Dog - My new reason for practicing mindfulness

- Theory - Learning to slow down, and be present will have massive benefits when get old and thinking becomes harder. If you've made it a habit

Anyone else seriously wanted to kill their dog? And gone through a bunch of plans to make it seem like an accident?

- Serious
- Semi-serious
- Silly

Yeah, I did. I knew getting my first dog would be quite a change but had no idea how much it would effect me. The combination of being kept up all night, constantly being mindful of this creature that is certainly not house trained yet and being around it all the time (I work from home), made me feel like I was losing my mind. I couldn't think clearly. As a programmer you work best by getting into flow states for a few hours.

For the first time in my life I got super scared about what it would be like to realise you mental faculties were diminishing. 

- Not being able to think properly
- Whilst knowing what you are normally capable of
- And knowing that it's not the temporary effects of something like drink, drugs or a short illness



When I got my cute little malti-poo I dramatically underestimated how much work it was going to be. I had heard that it would be a big change, but nothing like it was. 

Alas the first 2 weeks of being a dog daddy was not great.

I grew up with cats, which turns out are much easier to manage than dogs. I had heard this. But still dramatically underestimated how much work it would be.

...

I learnt a whole bunch of other stuff from this process:

- The importance of discipline
- Finding ways to test big decisions before taking them (pets before children)
- What it's like to dramatically underestimate something, even when you thought you were already being pessimistic about the outcome

But none of those were as important to write about for me.

P.s. I love my dog üëç

- Working at home, so got a dog
- Completely underestimated the responsibility
- Took up so much mental effort, just being aware, worrying about training etc. Lack of sleep
- First time in my life I couldn't think properly. Grandma died of Alzheimers, made me think about the process of going through that, losing your mental faculties
- Scariest thing of my life, wanted to kill the dog
- Didn't as it meant so much to my wife, trying to think of accidents to organise. Couldn't think properly to do anything about it though
- Really glad now, learnt so much
  - Discipline
  - Responsibility
  - Not going to underestimate responsibility again
  - So glad did this before children
  - Now think about how I'd go about accepting if I start losing my mind, not sure properly yet. Meditation, slowing down and living in the moment helps

What my main points for other people, rather than being an interesting story?

- Don't underestimate responsibility
- Get a pet before children
- Discipline makes things so much easier
- Don't kill your pets, I wouldn't have learnt how to accept it
- Losing your mind sucks, meditation, simplicity and living in the moment are great helpers for accepting that this might happen to you and how to deal with it (probably)
