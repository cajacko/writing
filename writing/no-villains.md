# No-one is the Villain of Their Own Story

NOTE: Focus is to bring in tonal elements from the fiction writing into this short non-fiction piece.

---

You're walking down the road, the sun is shining and you pleasantly whistle a tune to yourself. As you turn around a corner you're confronted with a stern faced man loudly crying out "Bugger, fuck shit wank". You give him a disgusted look and think to yourself "What an angry man" whilst giving him a wide berth.

It's a separate dull and depressing day. You're running late for work and run outside without an umbrella. It starts to rain. You forgot your wallet and bus pass, damn! As you stumble around a corner you stub your toe and cry out "Bugger, fuck shit wank". A passer by gives you a disgusted look and walks around you. You think to yourself "What a dick, anyone in my situation would have sworn like that".

No-one is the villain of their own story.

Wouldn't it be great if you could share all your thoughts and experiences with other people. So they would immediately understand why you're in a bad mood, or why you have that obscure belief about crop circles, aliens and probing. Alas we may never understand about your probing encounter but we can give people the benefit of the doubt when we catch ourselves judging them.

Every move we make is justified to ourselves in some fashion.

- Jared left the toilet seat up. Yeah, well Jared thinks it's more convenient and he only lives with guys.
- Mary didn't tip her waiter. Turns out that she thinks that all industries should get tips, or just pay people fairly and making a stand helps change things.
- Maurice didn't pick up his Costa Coffee cup off the sidewalk. Turns out he didn't even notice he'd dropped it, he's all up in his head, classic Maurice.

If every move anyone makes is justified to that person, then lets withhold judgement until we get a better understanding of what that justification is. Often it's something we've never even thought about, or couldn't have know. If we're never going to meet that person again, let's just assume they had a great reason for calling us a cunt on the phone. If it's someone we engage with often, Doris for instance, then by observing Doris' behaviour over time we can start forming a more accurate understanding of why she makes the decisions she does. And then you can start judging Doris for leaving her dirty drawers out on the side. But don't jump to conclusions, Doris still thinks she's the good guy.
