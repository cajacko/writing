# No-one is the Villain of Their Own Story

- Story - you see someone going down the road, swearing at something that happened to them. You judge
- Story - a bunch of unfair things happen to you, you end up going down the road swearing, totally justified
- We only see brief moments of other peoples lives, and never their full experience of events. Yet we apply generalisations onto that person based off that brief encounter.
- Is there any reason you can think of for why that person may have done that, and still be a good person
- Give the benefit of the doubt, as you expect others to do that to you
- It's only through repeated consistent behaviours that we can start forming more accurate judgements about a person. This is how we subconsciously find friends we like.

NOTE: Focus is to bring in tonal elements from the fiction writing into this short non-fiction piece.

You're walking down the road, the sun is shining and you pleasantly whistle a tune to yourself. As you turn around a corner you're confronted with a stern faced man swearing loudly. You give him a disgusted look and think to yourself "What an angry man" whilst giving him a wide berth.

It's a separate dull and depressing day. You're running late for work and ran outside without an umbrella. It starts to rain and you also forgot your wallet and bus pass. It's time to walk to work. As you stumble around a corner you stub your toe and swear loudly. A passer by gives you a disgusted look and walks around you. You think to yourself "What a dick, anyone in my situation would have sworn like that".

No-one is the villain of their own story.
