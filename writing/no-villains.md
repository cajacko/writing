# No-one is the Villain of Their Own Story

- Story - you see someone going down the road, swearing at something that happened to them. You judge
- Story - a bunch of unfair things happen to you, you end up going down the road swearing, totally justified
- We only see brief moments of other peoples lives, and never their full experience of events. Yet we apply generalisations onto that person based off that brief encounter.
- Is there any reason you can think of for why that person may have done that, and still be a good person
- Give the benefit of the doubt, as you expect others to do that to you
- It's only through repeated consistent behaviours that we can start forming more accurate judgements about a person. This is how we subconsciously find friends we like.

NOTE: Focus is to bring in tonal elements from the fiction writing into this short non-fiction piece.
