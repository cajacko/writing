# Why I Haven't Voted

- World is pretty good already
- The difference between the big parties doesn't feel like it makes much difference, don't mind either way who wins
- The cost of knowing enough to make an informed decision is too high for the benefit
  - Stopped reading the news for happiness test and is worth it
- I do not want people to follow my reasoning, otherwise the whole system doesn't work
- I wouldn't want to vote unless I knew enough about all the major parties

Against

- Selfish
- Even if the difference feels small to me, it doesn't for other people
  - Problem is you don't know exactly what impact will come from the party you vote for. More effective ways of helping people, than the time/sadness needed to keep up with the news
- I am privileged, others are much worse off. But why does that mean I should vote?
