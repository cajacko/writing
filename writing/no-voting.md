# Why I Don't Vote

If you are reading this, this piece is currently in a very loose draft state. And is mainly me trying to organise my own thinking and ideas and figure out if my thinking is justified or whether I've been horribly ignorant. With that in mind, please withhold judgement until it's finished.

---

- World is pretty good already
- The difference between the big parties doesn't feel like it makes much difference, don't mind either way who wins
- The cost of knowing enough to make an informed decision is too high for the benefit
  - Stopped reading the news for happiness test and is worth it
- I do not want people to follow my reasoning, otherwise the whole system doesn't work
- I wouldn't want to vote unless I knew enough about all the major parties

Against

- Selfish
- Even if the difference feels small to me, it doesn't for other people
  - Problem is you don't know exactly what impact will come from the party you vote for. More effective ways of helping people, than the time/sadness needed to keep up with the news
- I am privileged, others are much worse off. But why does that mean I should vote?

A few years ago, deep into my London hipster vibe, I was reading a lot about self development and happiness ðŸ˜€. I spent most of my time around East London, running a tech startup and going to the quirky bars where you sit on crates and barrels (to be fair I still do a lot of this now, it's fun ðŸ™ƒ but now I do improvised comedy as well ðŸŽ­).

During this time I started an experiment. I stopped reading the news. I'd read about how the news doubles done on negativity to help sell, and that small doses of consistent negativity each day can have a dramatic long term effect on your happiness. So time to find out if this was true... It was... I have never gone back to reading the news.

Turns out that I got all the information I needed to function in society just by the conversations I had with friends and family (NOTE: positive feedback loops). Unless you work in an industry where you need to know exactly what's going on in the world, I can't see a compelling reason to go back. Reading the news just made me slightly sadder and pessimistic on a daily basis, often in such subtle ways that I never realised until I cut it out for a few months.

(NOTE: Could bring up social media at some point in this post, but I don't have super strong feelings about it in regards to this, I don't use it because I don't gain from it, not sure it makes me sadder. Also this post is about voting)

Up until this point (I was maybe around 23 at the time), I hadn't voted yet. It was never something that really came up in my life or I thought about until around then (Oh how ignorance is bliss). But as I was living in London and getting older, I would hear more about politics, elections and all that crap. (NOTE: This is when I first started thinking about only voting if you know enough about each party to vote. Problem is that involves being current and doing the research...)
