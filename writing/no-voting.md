# Why I Don't Vote

If you are reading this, this piece is currently in a very loose draft state. And is mainly me trying to organise my own thinking and ideas and figure out if my thinking is justified or whether I've been horribly ignorant. With that in mind, please withhold judgement until it's finished.

---

- World is pretty good already
- The difference between the big parties doesn't feel like it makes much difference, don't mind either way who wins
- The cost of knowing enough to make an informed decision is too high for the benefit
  - Stopped reading the news for happiness test and is worth it
- I do not want people to follow my reasoning, otherwise the whole system doesn't work
- I wouldn't want to vote unless I knew enough about all the major parties

Against

- Selfish
- Even if the difference feels small to me, it doesn't for other people
  - Problem is you don't know exactly what impact will come from the party you vote for. More effective ways of helping people, than the time/sadness needed to keep up with the news
- I am privileged, others are much worse off. But why does that mean I should vote?

A few years ago, deep into my London hipster vibe, I was reading a lot about self development and happiness ðŸ˜€. I spent most of my time around East London, running a tech startup and going to the quirky bars where you sit on crates and barrels (to be fair I still do a lot of this now, it's fun ðŸ™ƒ but now I do improvised comedy as well ðŸŽ­).

During this time I started an experiment. I stopped reading the news. I'd read about how the news doubles done on negativity to help sell, and that small doses of consistent negativity each day can have a dramatic long term effect on your happiness. So time to find out if this was true... It was... I have never gone back to reading the news.

Turns out that I got all the information I needed to function in society just by the conversations I had with friends and family (NOTE: positive feedback loops). Unless you work in an industry where you need to know exactly what's going on in the world, I can't see a compelling reason to go back (NOTE: Brainstorm more reasons to check this). Reading the news just made me slightly sadder and pessimistic on a daily basis, often in such subtle ways that I never realised until I cut it out for a few months.

(NOTE: Could bring up social media at some point in this post, but I don't have super strong feelings about it in regards to this, I don't use it because I don't gain from it, not sure it makes me sadder. Also this post is about voting)

Up until this point (I was around 23 at the time), I hadn't voted yet. It was never something that really came up in my life or I thought about until around then (Oh how ignorance is bliss). But as I was living in London and getting older, I would hear more about politics, elections and all that crap. Turns out conversations do get more serious as you get older.

I started thinking about it more, discussing this mad world of politics and voting with friends and family. To me it seemed ridiculous that people could vote without knowing a reasonable amount about all parties. Why don't we have and exam you need to pass in order to vote? I would think. I certainly didn't feel qualified enough to vote on who should run the country. I have since realised that democracy isn't about the best people leading, but about keeping those in charge scared of the general public so they don't get all "dictatory". The best of a bunch of non ideal options.

I still hold the belief that my vote would be useless or counter productive if I didn't know an even amount about each reasonably sized party. Which ties us back into reading the news. This was something I did not want to do, and had shown made me happier. So now the question was:

> Is it worth reading the news and staying up to date, which decreases my daily happiness, so that I feel informed enough to vote?

There's got to be a pretty good reason to vote to suffer those consequences.

So, how fucked is the world. And is it fucked enough to warrant the daily dose of sadness to vote. Answer: The world is awesome and keeps getting better. Why the hell would I vote. It's like choosing between your 2 favourite meals. (NOTE: It's not the parties that are the meals, just the state of the world after the parties have done their thing.) I don't particular mind which one I have, they're both great. So why agonise over the choice (NOTE: This metaphor is probably one of the best ways to convey my general thoughts about the issue. Great either way, so no point in voting until one of the options is not great.)
