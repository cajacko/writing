# Why I Don't Vote

If you are reading this, this piece is currently in a very loose draft state. And is mainly me trying to organise my own thinking and ideas and figure out if my ideas are justified or whether I've been horribly ignorant. With that in mind, please withhold judgement until it's finished.

---

A few years ago, deep into my London hipster vibe, I was reading a lot about self development and happiness 😀. I spent most of my time around East London, running a tech startup and going to the quirky bars where you sit on crates and barrels (to be fair I still do a lot of this now, it's fun but now I do improvised comedy as well 🎭).

During this time I started an experiment. I stopped reading the news. I'd read about how the news doubles done on negativity to help sell, and that small doses of consistent negativity each day can have a dramatic long term effect on your happiness 😢. So time to find out if this was true... It was... I have never gone back to reading the news.

Turns out that I got all the information I needed to function in society just by the conversations I had with friends and family (NOTE: positive feedback loops). Unless you work in an industry where you need to know exactly what's going on in the world, I can't see a compelling reason to go back (NOTE: Brainstorm more reasons to check this). Reading the news just made me slightly sadder and pessimistic on a daily basis, often in such subtle ways that I never realised until I cut it out for a few months.

(NOTE: Could bring up social media at some point in this post, but I don't have super strong feelings about it in regards to this, I don't use it because I don't gain from it, not sure it makes me sadder. Also this post is about voting)

Up until this point (I was around 23 at the time), I hadn't voted yet. It was never something that really came up in my life or I thought about until around then (oh how ignorance is bliss). But as I was living in London and getting older, I would hear more about politics, elections and all that crap 💩. Turns out conversations do get more serious as you get older.

I started thinking about it more, discussing this mad world of politics and voting with friends and family. To me it seemed ridiculous that people could vote without knowing a reasonable amount about all parties. Why don't we have an exam you need to pass in order to vote? I would think. I certainly didn't feel qualified enough to vote on who should run the country. I have since realised that democracy isn't about the electing the best people, but about keeping those in charge scared of the general public so they don't get all "dictatory". Democracy seems to be the best of a bunch of non ideal options.

I still hold the belief that my vote would be useless or counter productive if I didn't know an even amount about each reasonably sized party. Which ties us back into reading the news. This was something I did not want to do, and had shown makes me happier when I don't. So now the question was:

> Is it worth reading the news and staying up to date, which decreases my daily happiness, so that I feel informed enough to vote?

NOTE: What other alternatives are there to keep up to date, without reading negative news

There's got to be a pretty good reason to vote to suffer those consequences. This led me to look at the problem in the following way:

- What is the problem that my vote will help to solve?
- How big of a problem is it?
- Will my vote help to solve that problem?
- What is the cost of voting?
- Overall is the benefit gained worth the consequences?

So let's look at these points in more detail.

## What is the problem that my vote will help to solve?

Errr...making a better world...duh!

Voting is about choosing who you think would make you (depending how selfless you are 😇) and your country (and by extension the world 🌍) better off compared to the other candidates. This could mean who will do less harm, as well as who will do most good. Either way the goal is the same, try and make yourself (again depending on 😇) and as many people as happy as possible.

It's always possible to improve the world. There's no cap on how awesome we can be, unless maybe we find a way to keep every living thing in a constant state of eternal happiness, even past the heat death of the universe.

## How big of a problem is it?

Making the world a better place is always an important problem. But as the world improves and becomes more equal the scale of the problem decreases. When most people in the world are dying of hunger the problem is huge, when the problem shifts to most of the population being fed but don't have a great sense of love or belonging, the problem is still important, but less pressing than it was before.

We can look at Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to get a rough sense of the order of problems to solve for humanity. For a full breakdown of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs go here, otherwise I'll assume you're somewhat familiar.

In a very loose sense I like to think of the size of each colour band in this triangle representing the relative importance of the problem compared to the others. For example it's more important to solve your physiological needs, like food, before solving your safety needs, like security of employment.

We can look at this Hierarchy of Needs and pick a point on it for where humanity as an average is at. Where is most of humanity of this measure. Defining an exact point is tricky and not overly useful but over the last thousands of years we've been dramatically climbing this pyramid, getting more and more of the population higher and higher.

If you look on the scale of 10/20 years it would be hard to see any trends, but even in the last 100 years, the world has been excelling in population well being.

So although we can always make the world better, and it's super important to pull up people on the lower rungs of this pyramid, everything keeps getting better, so the scale of the problem is shrinking. 

When it comes to making the world a better place, you get the most impact from your effort by bringing people up from the bottom. (NOTE: Voting between such similar parties doesn't help in this. Giving to charity does.)

## Will my vote help to solve that problem?

In this section we look at what impact a vote actually has on making the country and world a better place. A vote is helping to choose a winner between the parties that have a chance in the election. Which means I should pick a party that will result in a better world than the others.

From what I can tell, the differences between all the parties likely to win an election are so small (NOTE: How do I know that if I don't read the news) that the predicted net benefit to the world is the same regardless of who wins. We like to think that the parties are wildly different, but on the grand scheme of dictators at one end and open anarchy at the other, all the parties in the election occupy a very tiny range on that spectrum. 

It's like having a huge family dinner. Where your grandparents are cooking and are going to serve everyone the same meal, but let you all choose between 2 (each meal is the state of the world after the people you voted in have finished their term in office). It just so happens that these 2 meals are both your favourite. I don't particular mind which one I have, they're both great. So I'll let everyone else at the table pick.

Now if we did get to a point where that range get's big enough that there would be a predictable difference in the net benefit to the world, that's when I'd come in to vote (In our dinner metaphor this is like a 3rd choice being something you like but not as much as the other 2). This is what happened during the Brexit vote, which is the one time I have voted, as I thought the world would be a better place if we were more together with each other. And being a single issue it made it much easier to predict a net benefit to the world.

It's also pretty impossible to figure out what the net benefit will be of each major party winning. Mixed in with the fact that the parties don't/can't always do what they promised, makes it more a game of trust and instinct than anything concrete.

So, will my vote help solve the problem? Probably not when the difference is so small and the predicted impact is so fuzzy.

## What is the cost of voting?

## Overall, is the benefit gained worth the consequences?

Nope

- The problem isn't that large, as the worlds great
- Voting won't solve the problem because you can't be sure the changes you want will happen, and they're all so similar anyway
- The downsides are huge
- I can be more useful in society as a happy, productive member, than a sad sack complaining about the world
- Don't care which party wins, as they are all so similar and I think the net benefit to the world will be the same or impossible to predict

## Final thoughts

NOTE: I do not want people to follow my reasoning, otherwise the whole system doesn't work

(NOTE: Research common reasons to vote and answer through this? Or add my response as a bonus section at end)

NOTE: (There are other ways to improve the world without the negative consequences of voting) Companies do more, focus on building better things to improve the world
