# Why I Don't Vote

If you are reading this, this piece is currently in a very loose draft state. And is mainly me trying to organise my own thinking and ideas and figure out if my ideas are justified or whether I've been horribly ignorant. With that in mind, please withhold judgement until it's finished.

A few years ago, deep into my London hipster vibe, I was reading a lot about self development and happiness üòÄ. I spent most of my time around East London, running a tech startup and going to the quirky bars where you sit on crates and barrels (to be fair I still do a lot of this now, it's fun but now I do improvised comedy as well üé≠).

During this time I started an experiment. I stopped reading the news. I'd read about how the news doubles done on negativity to help sell, and that small doses of consistent negativity each day can have a dramatic long term effect on your happiness üò¢. So time to find out if this was true... It was... I have never gone back to reading the news.

Turns out that I got all the information I needed to function in society just by the conversations I had with friends and family (NOTE: positive feedback loops). Unless you work in an industry where you need to know exactly what's going on in the world, I can't see a compelling reason to go back (NOTE: Brainstorm more reasons to check this). Reading the news just made me slightly sadder and pessimistic on a daily basis, often in such subtle ways that I never realised until I cut it out for a few months.

(NOTE: Could bring up social media at some point in this post, but I don't have super strong feelings about it in regards to this, I don't use it because I don't gain from it, not sure it makes me sadder. Also this post is about voting)

Up until this point (I was around 23 at the time), I hadn't voted yet. It was never something that really came up in my life or I thought about until around then (oh how ignorance is bliss). But as I was living in London and getting older, I would hear more about politics, elections and all that crap üí©. Turns out conversations do get more serious as you get older.

I started thinking about it more, discussing this mad world of politics and voting with friends and family. To me it seemed ridiculous that people could vote without knowing a reasonable amount about all parties. Why don't we have an exam you need to pass in order to vote? I would think. I certainly didn't feel qualified enough to vote on who should run the country. I have since realised that democracy isn't about the electing the best people, but about keeping those in charge scared of the general public so they don't get all "dictatory". Democracy seems to be the best of a bunch of non ideal options.

I still hold the belief that my vote would be useless or counter productive if I didn't know an even amount about each reasonably sized party. Which ties us back into reading the news. This was something I did not want to do, and had shown makes me happier when I don't. So now the question was:

> Is it worth reading the news and staying up to date, which decreases my daily happiness, so that I feel informed enough to vote?

NOTE: What other alternatives are there to keep up to date, without reading negative news

There's got to be a pretty good reason to vote to suffer those consequences. This led me to look at the problem in the following way:

- What is the problem that my vote will help to solve?
- How big of a problem is it?
- Will my vote help to solve that problem?
- What is the cost of voting?
- Overall is the benefit gained worth the consequences?

So let's look at these points in more detail.

## What is the problem that my vote will help to solve?

Errr...making a better world...duh!

Voting is about choosing who you think would make you (depending how selfless you are üòá) and your country (and by extension the world üåç) better off compared to the other candidates. This could mean who will do less harm, as well as who will do most good. Either way the goal is the same, try and make yourself (again depending on üòá) and as many people as happy as possible.

It's always possible to improve the world. There's no cap on how awesome we can be, unless maybe we find a way to keep every living thing in a constant state of eternal happiness, even past the heat death of the universe.

## How big of a problem is it?

Making the world a better place is always an important problem. But as the world improves and becomes more equal the scale of the problem decreases. When most people in the world are dying of hunger the problem is huge, when the problem shifts to most of the population being fed but don't have a great sense of love or belonging, the problem is still important, but less pressing than it was before.

We can look at Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to get a rough sense of the order of problems to solve for humanity. For a full breakdown of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs go here, otherwise I'll assume you're somewhat familiar.

![Maslow](../assets/maslows-hierarchy-of-needs.svg)

In a very loose sense I like to think of the size of each colour band in this triangle representing the relative importance of the problem compared to the others. For example it's more important to solve your physiological needs, like food, before solving your safety needs, like security of employment.

We can look at this Hierarchy of Needs and pick a point on it for where humanity as an average is at. Where is most of humanity of this measure. Defining an exact point is tricky and not overly useful but over the last thousands of years we've been dramatically climbing this pyramid, getting more and more of the population higher and higher.

If you look on the scale of 10/20 years it would be hard to see any trends, but even in the last 100 years, the world has been excelling in population well being.

So although we can always make the world better, and it's super important to pull up people on the lower rungs of this pyramid, everything keeps getting better, so the scale of the problem is shrinking. 

When it comes to making the world a better place, you get the most impact from your effort by bringing people up from the bottom. (NOTE: Voting between such similar parties doesn't help in this. Giving to charity does.)

## Will my vote help to solve that problem?

In this section we look at what impact a vote actually has on making the country and world a better place. A vote is helping to choose a winner between the parties that have a chance in the election. Which means I should pick a party that will result in a better world than the others.

From what I can tell, the differences between all the parties likely to win an election are so small (NOTE: How do I know that if I don't read the news) that the predicted net benefit to the world is the same regardless of who wins. We like to think that the parties are wildly different, but on the grand scheme of dictators at one end and open anarchy at the other, all the parties in the election occupy a very tiny range on that spectrum. 

It's like having a huge family dinner. Where your grandparents are cooking and are going to serve everyone the same meal, but let you all choose between 2 (each meal is the state of the world after the people you voted in have finished their term in office). It just so happens that these 2 meals are both your favourite. I don't particular mind which one I have, they're both great. So I'll let everyone else at the table pick.

Now if we did get to a point where that range get's big enough that there would be a predictable difference in the net benefit to the world, that's when I'd come in to vote (In our dinner metaphor this is like a 3rd choice being something you like but not as much as the other 2). This is what happened during the Brexit vote, which is the one time I have voted, as I thought the world would be a better place if we were more together with each other. And being a single issue it made it much easier to predict a net benefit to the world.

It's also pretty impossible to figure out what the net benefit will be of each major party winning. Mixed in with the fact that the parties don't/can't always do what they promised, makes it more a game of trust and instinct than anything concrete.

So, will my vote help solve the problem? Probably not when the difference is so small and the predicted impact is so fuzzy.

## What is the cost of voting?

In the intro to this post, I talked about an uninformed vote being pointless or worse case actually against what you're trying to achieve (by accidentally voting for a party that wants to do the opposite of what you want). So for an informed vote, you need to be informed. 

Reading the news isn't a great idea, we talked about it have a strong contribution to unhappiness. But there are other ways to have an informed vote. You could specifically go to read non biased articles, manifestos and debates. Problem is, none of these are particularly fun either. They all involve super boring topics and you'd need to go through quite a lot to get a good idea of what each major party stands for. All of this takes time.

When looking at the root problem of making the world a better place, I'd argue that the time I'd spend to stay informed would be better spent doing something else to improve the world. Even if that time goes towards earning more money so that you can give to charity. Or building products and companies that improve peoples lives. These are things that are more fun for me to do, and I think has a greater impact on the world.

## Overall, is the benefit gained worth the consequences?

I wrote this post to see if I'd change my mind by going through the argument. I still think that I can improve the world more by keeping myself happy, giving to charity and building products and companies, rather than spending the time needed to have an informed vote. A happy Charlie, does better, more inspired work. And makes me have a better outlook on helping people. 

The world of politics and voting comes with such a strong cost, for something that (at the moment) won't result in much difference. The major parties are all so similar on the grand scheme of things, the world is improving so much anyway and you really can't be sure what they'll do when voted in. So I really don't see a compelling reason to vote. I'm happy with any of the likely parties to win.

## Final thoughts

I really don't want anyone else to follow in my footsteps here. My reasoning only works because everyone else votes and gets in these awesome parties (political parties, not fun parties. Although those also help ü•≥) that all help make the world a great place.

Part of writing this post was to explore my own reasoning and invite other views to comment on areas I may have missed.

If there was an organisation like Effective Altruism (which is my favourite charity to give to), but recommended who to vote for I would totally vote on what they recommend. Having a bunch of trusted rationalists do all that research for you, and go further than 1 person could ever research would completely change my mind.

I guess I could look at who my trusted friends vote for and weigh that up in terms of how rational I think they are. But I can't be so sure on their bias's and would have to have those political discussion with them, which doesn't particularly add to my happiness. 

Here's some parts of this argument that would be useful for me to research more, but I'm not going to at the moment, due to the time already invested in this piece:

- Is an uninformed vote really worse than no vote at all? 
- Are you still more likely to vote in a better party of instinct and minimal research than accidentally vote in a worse one?
- Clearly no one/the government hasn't given me a compelling reason to vote yet. Is it better for people like me not to vote so they see this as a growing problem that they need to spend more resources to address?
- Maybe there are some good sources for keeping informed which aren't so depressing or boring? But I don't know about them.
- NOTE: Read through whole thing and add here

TODO: 

- Go through all NOTE's
- Add the custom graph on the point at which anybody would stop voting, and how mine is just further over than yours
- Rewrite everything with my tone of voice
- Ensure points all make sense and are in a logical flow
