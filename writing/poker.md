# Poker

High stakes poker game. Maybe mob/underground. Start by building the tension. Then there's a round where everyone think's they've got it and people start going all in. Then people raise the bets by doing the jewellery/car keys thing. Then it get's silly.

The game of the scene is more ridiculous bets

A sub game could be misunderstanding poker

The final reveal could be that they're not playing poker, or playing cards with animals on or something. Although the ducks on cards could be something early on. Saying I lost my cards, these are my kids, do you have a problem or want to make some money.

Remember to rest the games

Could get to a point where people are holding more serious weapons under the table. In the final section they fire... water guns. Same time next week.

(Could treat it in a very tense and serious way but everything they're doing is not poker related e.g. Snap, go fish etc)

The five figures lean back in their chairs. A dim light hangs in the centre of the room, hovering just over the worn circular table. Shadows being cast in every corner, only the contents of the table are lit. Showing an array of betting chips, cards and drinks. The haze of smoke is in the air, constantly being topped up by each pull of the cigars. And the occasional burst from a vape (there's always one who feels like ruining the tone).

Scanning around the room we see familiar, notorious faces. Big Dave, Tommy Two Hands, Sherique the Grim, Jimmy Al Fresco  and Mary Smith of 4 Puddlestone Hill, just down from the post office by the pond. The one in that delightful cottage with the thatch roof and rododendras flourishing outside.
