# Overcoming your primitive mind

Hello monkey brain 🐒. Do you often make stupid decisions in the heat of the moment? Mmmm cake for breakfast? Yeah why not. Oh lunch time...cake? Sure. Oh look and incredibly attractive person who isn't my partner, shall we have sex? Woo hoo 🛏🍆🍑...oh no 😢. 

Yeah we all do. It's our primitive monkey brain getting in the way. The caveman, kill your food and keep fucking part of you. And it can be a bit of a dick. 

Nowadays our higher mind (the deep thinking, intellectual hopefully clever part) is the part of the brain that we want to be making our decisions for us 💡. It knows that going against the monkey brain in specific situations will lead to even more happiness in the long term 🙃.

The tricky bit is getting the higher mind to override that monkey brain. I find that the most effective way to start is to just be more aware of when the monkey brain is in control. From there it becomes easier to make conscious decisions for your higher mind to take over.

So here's a whole bunch of common situations and established biases where the monkey brain is often in control and leading to undesirable ☹️ outcomes:

- Getting angry in arguments and spurting out aggressive nonsense
- Sunk cost fallacy
- Hangry
- Cheating on your partner(s)
- Herd mentality
- Confirmation bias
- Overconfidence
- Narrative fallacy

BONUS: check out a great list of different biases [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases).

Whenever you notice your monkey brain kicking in, take a moment, take a breath, and then get that higher mind back in control.
