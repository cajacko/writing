# Overcoming your primitive mind

- Our animal brains control a large portion of our life
    - Instinct
    - Emotions
- But our higher minds, don't always agree with that primitive brain
- So how can we get our higher minds to override the primitive
    - Be aware of when this happens (retrospectively)
        - Bias
        - Notice behaviours you don't like in yourself
    - Decide what you want to change
    - Work on changing those behaviours
        - Take time
        - Meditation
        - Read more bias, awareness helps tackle
        - Trick yourself
            - Make use of primitive mind/habit training to develop the behaviours you want
