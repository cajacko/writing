# Give up all your data

- Your shooting yourself in the foot by not giving companies all your data
- Companies don't want to spam you, they want to give you advertising that will directly lead to a purchase. Which means only targeting people who want that product.
- As a consumer I want to be told about products I don't necessarily know about or much about, but want to buy. Everyone would.
- Companies can only advertise like this by knowing enough about you to only advertise things you want
- I also want better products. How do people make better products? By knowing what you like, dislike and how you use the products. They need your data.
- There are some instances where you shouldn't give out your data or be aware of the effect it has.
    - Location data and being robbed/assulted
    - Positive feedback loops that can be dangerous, misleading or wrong (fake news)
