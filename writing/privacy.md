# Give up all your data

- Your shooting yourself in the foot by not giving companies all your data
- Companies don't want to spam you, they want to give you advertising that will directly lead to a purchase. Which means only targeting people who want that product.
- As a consumer I want to be told about products I don't necessarily know about or much about, but want to buy. Everyone would.
- Companies can only advertise like this by knowing enough about you to only advertise things you want
- I also want better products. How do people make better products? By knowing what you like, dislike and how you use the products. They need your data.
- There are some instances where you shouldn't give out your data or be aware of the effect it has.
    - Location data and being robbed/assulted
    - Positive feedback loops that can be dangerous, misleading or wrong (fake news)


Imagine a world where everything that was advertised to you, was only ever something that you would buy. What a wonderful place to live. No more spam, or spending ages searching through the shit for the things you want or need.

And companies want this too. Companies waste so much money advertising to people who will never buy their products. They could save so much money and reinvest in making even better products for you.

Now imagine that when the companies are designing these products, they knew exactly how to build the perfect product for you. They could see how you used previous products, competitors products and how to fit their new product into your life and habits. You'd be pleased with something that was beautiful and worked incredibly well, and the company would be super happy with the shortened amount of time needed to continuously test and iterate products. And the loyalty and customer satisfaction are great too.

This isn't a ridiculous sci-fi scenario, it's certainly possible to build towards. The companies just need your data. Ideally all of it. They need to know that you don't like x so they don't have to waste money advertising it to you. They need to know how you have x habit, so they can build an y that does z.

Unfortunately people appear to be over paranoid when it comes to privacy and their data. There are some cases where it's important to keep your data private:

- Location data for burglary, assualt, worse crimes
- Positive feedback loops from news and fake news (although this is another problem about evidence and knowing what to believe, but ignorant people won't know this)

So know what data needs to be secure, but for the rest, give it freely. Help make the world a spam free place filled with products specifically designed for you. Otherwise you're just shooting yourself in the foot.
