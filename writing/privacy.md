# Give up all your data

Imagine a world where everything that was advertised to you was only something that you would buy. No more spam, or spending ages searching through the shit for the things you want or need. Sounds great!

And companies want this too. They waste so much money advertising to people who will never buy their products. They could save so much and spend more on making better products for you.

Now imagine that when the companies are designing these products, they knew exactly how to build the perfect product for you. They could see how you used previous products, competitors products and how to fit their new product into your life. Now you're happy that you have a better product, and they're happy you keep buying from them.

We can get there! But the companies need your data. Ideally all of it. They need to know that you don't like x so they don't have to waste money advertising it to you. They need to know how you have x habit, so they can build an y that does z.

At the moment many of us are overly paranoid when it comes to privacy and personal data. You know no person is looking at your  individual cloud data. It's only machines and algorithms going through it. Giving trend data to companies to help build better products for you, and let you know about things you want. Privacy is starting to sound pretty selfish.

I get that there are some cases where it's important for your security to keep your data private, (NOTE: about not sharing some stuff socially e.g. location data. This post is concerned with giving data to companies not social). And that people should be more aware of the dangers of positive feedback loops (which aren't entirely a bad thing, especially if you're aware of it).

So know what data needs to be private, but for the rest, give it freely. Help make the world a spam free place filled with products specifically designed for you. Otherwise you're just shooting yourself in the foot.

NOTE: This post is about giving data to companies, not sharing socially. Make that clear somewhere and tailor everything to this.
