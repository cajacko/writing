# Religion is obviously false

- Everything has a probability of being true or untrue
- To believe in something is to looks at the evidence in favour of that belief and decide that it amounts to at least a 50% chance of being correct
- There's no point in beleiving anything that doesn't have at least 50% chance of being true as it's most likely to be wrong
- All evidence has a percentage of being correct, the easier it is to repeat and other people to validate, the more likely that evidence is of being correct
  - All religious text as evidence is very weak evidence
- It's ok to not have answers yet, more for us to study and test new theories against
- The only evidence religion provides is written accounts from thousands of years ago
- Any of these written accounts have a probability of being accurate
- If they weren't first hand accounts, that probability goes down
- Everytime the account was rewritten or translated, that probability goes down
- When more separate accounts of the same thing are written and agree, the probability goes up
- If claims are being made about how the world should currently work

* 2 things here

  - Accuracy of written accounts of historical events
  - The testability of claims about the way the world works

* Accuracy of written accounts of historical events
  - The longer ago something was originally written, the lower the probability of it being correct
  - If the account was written by somebody who actually did or witnessed it, the probability is much lower
  - If the person who wrote it was likely to be biased in favour of the points, the probability is lower
  - If the account is about something to do with the way the world works, but can't be tested now, the probaility is lower
  - If the account was preserved and edited by an organisation that had a clear political incentive to enforce it and reject counter arguments, the probability is lower
  - If there's no physical evidence to backup the account, the probability is lower
  - When there are more likely or simpler explanations the probability is lower
* The testability of claims about the way the world works
  - If a theory can't be tested, there's no reason to believe in it? Is that reasoning ok?

If you can't test a theory in the modern day and come up with at least a 50% chance of your results being correct. You really shouldn't let that theory control important aspects of your life. As no part of religion can be tested in the modern day with current technology the only evidence we can look at is historical accounts. But we need to look at the credibility of that evidence. If there is additional physical evidence (not written stories), then that can help. Otherwise we have to look at all the factors that can adjust the probability of a written account being true:

- Intelligence of the person who witnessed the account
- Gullability of that person
- If a first hand witness was the person who wrote it
- The chances of that account being edited

I understand the desire to want to believe in it. Understanding there's something more and dying isn't the end. Someone who loves you unconditionally. etc. But staking important decisions in your life from beliefs in soemthing that can't be proven from sources which are unlikely to be true (and not massively adjusted tyhrough 1000's of years of people with strong motivations to change it) is not a wise idea.

The chances of it being correct are so slim. And beleiving irrationally can inspire others to do so, and lead you to make decisions which are ill informed.
