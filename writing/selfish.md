# How selfish should you be 😇

As humans all we really want to do is increase our personal happiness. Helping others is just a way of satisfying our own goals. If you're in control of your actions, I don't think it's possible to be truly selfless (Boom! Bold opening statement 😉).

But that doesn't mean we have to be selfish dicks 🍆 all the time. There're many aspects to helping others that can help you enjoy life more, either in the short or long term:

- That warm fuzzy 🐻 feeling of being a good person
- Being seen and treated as a good person. Be nice and people are more likely to be nice back.
- The more people we can bring out of poverty and help make happier 🙃, the more productive they can be in society. All of which helps us tackle the big issues like; climate change, colonising other planets and stalling death. Which definitely benefits yourself.

And a lot of activities that don't initially seem like they're directly helping people can end up having a bigger impact on others lives than going out to build shelters somewhere:

- Building businesses that contribute to the economy, employ people and up-skill them.
- Researching/developing new technology that may end up changing the lives of millions of people.
- Providing entertainment such as music or comedy 🤣 that improves the well being of many people's lives.

You also need to focus on developing yourself if you want to be better at helping others:

> If you spent 3 out of 10 years learning how to make yourself 200% more effective at helping people. You would help more people in the other 7 years than if you spent 10 years helping people but not learning how to be 200% more effective.

We also work better when we're happy, healthy and motivated. Which means you'll help people in a more effective way. Everyone's a winner 🥳.

It's still important for some of us to directly help people. Being on the ground level, getting to know the real problems and feeding that back is super important. That's why we need a mixture of different types of help.

So don't worry too much about the scale at which you're helping people. As long as you're not on either extreme of; ensuring what you do isn't improving others or neglecting your own self development to build individual shelters somewhere. Then you're helping just fine.
