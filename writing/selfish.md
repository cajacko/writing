# How selfish should you be ðŸ˜‡

- A humans goal is to enjoy their lives, optimise their happiness
- In our societies helping others often brings you short or long term joy or fulfilment, contributing to your individual happiness (some argue helping others, is an innate desire of humans, I press the bullshit button here)
- Helping others is great. You feel better, they feel better. The more people who feel better and can live full lives, the more people to help build a better future with less global warming, more exploring space, transcending our bodies and living indefinitely. Helping people is great.
- But life is a balance. If you just spent your time helping others and giving all your food, money and time to helping others you would starve, have less time and money to spend on improving yourself which could in turn lead to you helping more people
- We also work better when we're happy, healthy and motivated. Which means helping people in a more effective way.
- So how do we strike that balance.
- The other end of the spectrum is just doing things for yourself, which also doesn't often work in increasing your long term happiness
- You also can't save or help everybody, and have to realise that. There will always be suffering, or people suffering more than you. Even if we bring everyone above the poverty line, the people at the bottom of society will be considered "suffering" compared to those at the top.
- So find your balance and be ok with that. We can't all spend time building shelters, and that's not necessarily the most effective way of helping people. It takes people helping in all kinds of ways to improve the world:
    - Donating hard cash
    - Building businesses to employ people
    - Researching everything from medical, mental health and self improvement helps people
    - Advancing technology helps people
    - Being an entertainer: film, comedy, sports etc helps people enjoy life
- Having this mix of helping people is super important. So don't feel guilty about not doing x y z, as long as you've thought about how what you do helps others as well as yourself, carry on.

- This post is about making people think about how their life choices are helping people. And where they are on the balance between selfish and selflessness. Then it's up to them to decide how they feel about their position. Just get them thinking.

Here's a fun scale for ya:

- __+100%__ - Massive dick who does everything only for themselves and doesn't mind everyone else knowing that.
- __+50%__ - A mostly selfish individual who does help others, but normally it's only to help themselves
- __0%__ - The balancer, who does a mix of things for themselves and others
- __-50%__ - The Good Samaritan who loves to focus on helping other people, but still takes time for themselves
- __-100%__ - The devoted who spends their every waking moment helping others, thinking about others and neglecting their own self interest for the good of others. Probably not a well rounded person as they don't spend much time on self improvement

We all exist somewhere on this scale, often occupying different points at different times in our lives. I don't think there's a *right* place to be on the scale. I think the world should have a mixture of people between __+75%__ - __-75%__. I don't think either extremes are particular useful, except for being examples to motivate others not to be like that.

I do believe that we help others only because it increases our personal short or long term well being, whether that's the sense of satisfaction, fulfilment for living a good life or because you get off when people thank you. So in some way we're all 100% selfish.

But I use this scale to try and emphasise 

Don't think people are happy at either extreme.

Maybe the point is to keep trying different zones on the scale throughout your life. You can do more good after you've worked on yourself, and you can do lots of good when focussing on others. So keep switching, know where you are but stay clear of the extremes.
