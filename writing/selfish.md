# How selfish should you be ðŸ˜‡

- A humans goal is to enjoy their lives, optimise their happiness
- In our societies helping others often brings you short or long term joy or fulfilment, contributing to your individual happiness (some argue helping others, is an innate desire of humans, I press the bullshit button here)
- Helping others is great. You feel better, they feel better. The more people who feel better and can live full lives, the more people to help build a better future with less global warming, more exploring space, transcending our bodies and living indefinitely. Helping people is great.
- But life is a balance. If you just spent your time helping others and giving all your food, money and time to helping others you would starve, have less time and money to spend on improving yourself which could in turn lead to you helping more people
- We also work better when we're happy, healthy and motivated. Which means helping people in a more effective way.
- So how do we strike that balance.
- The other end of the spectrum is just doing things for yourself, which also doesn't often work in increasing your long term happiness
- You also can't save or help everybody, and have to realise that. There will always be suffering, or people suffering more than you. Even if we bring everyone above the poverty line, the people at the bottom of society will be considered "suffering" compared to those at the top.
- So find your balance and be ok with that. We can't all spend time building shelters, and that's not necessarily the most effective way of helping people. It takes people helping in all kinds of ways to improve the world:
    - Donating hard cash
    - Building businesses to employ people
    - Researching everything from medical, mental health and self improvement helps people
    - Advancing technology helps people
    - Being an entertainer: film, comedy, sports etc helps people enjoy life

We can only ever choose to do things for our own selfish reasons. Yes even (silly example). Every action (in our control) that we take is to improve our short term happiness, long term happiness or to stay true to our individual moral codes which help us feel like we have fulfilling lives (basically long term happiness again).

Either way, whether you're donating to charity, helping a stranger in the street or sacrificing your life for somebody else, you're doing it for one of the reasons above. (Add in silly example)

This doesn't mean that we should fully embrace our inner selfishness and fuck over everyone else (sorry ðŸ˜¢). Helping other people can make us feel good in the short term, long term and adheres to many of our personal moral codes that help us feel fulfilled in life. Also, being a nice and generous person usually makes people treat you better in return, so everyone's a winner, especially you!

When it comes to how selfish you act and appear I like to use the following scale:

- __+100%__ - Massive dick who does everything only for themselves and doesn't mind everyone else knowing that. Not particularly useful to society, although may be by accident.
- __+50%__ - A mostly selfish individual who does help others, but normally it's only to help themselves.
- __0%__ - The balancer, who does a mix of things for themselves and others.
- __-50%__ - The Good Samaritan who loves to focus on helping other people, but still takes time for themselves.
- __-100%__ - The devoted who spends their every waking moment helping others, thinking about others and neglecting their own self interest for the good of others. The problem is, if you don't improve yourself and stay happy you're going to be worse at helping others. e.g. If you spent 3 out of 10 years learning how to make yourself 200% more effective at helping people. You would help more people in the other 7 years than if you spent 10 years helping people but not learning how to be 200% more effective.

I think it's important to identify where you are on this scale and play around with different parts over your life time. We need people in the world at every stage (although the people on both extremes should just serve as inspiration to others, not to be these people).

Slightly more selfish people are useful because
- Nerd out and build useless tech (advancement)
- Get super invested in weird niche subjects with no obvious application
- Build monolithic companies, make loads of money and inspire the economy

More selfless people to:
- Understand the problems people are actually facing
- Help people on the ground
- Inspire us all to be better

So have a play on this scale, accept that you can't help everyone and as long as you're not too far to one extreme stop worrying about being whether you're too selfish and enjoy your life. You'll be more effective at helping people when you're happier and healthier.

NOTE: Does some part of this need to be in here? (You also can't save or help everybody, and have to realise that. There will always be suffering, or people suffering more than you. Even if we bring everyone above the poverty line, the people at the bottom of society will be considered "suffering" compared to those at the top.)

As humans all we really want to do is increase our personal happiness. Helping others is just a way of satisfying our own goals. If you're in control of your actions, I don't think it's possible to be truly selfless.

But that doesn't mean we have to be selfish dicks all the time. There're many aspects to helping others that can help you enjoy life more, either in the short or long term:

- That warm fuzzy feeling of being a good person
- Being seen and treated as a good person. Be nice and people are more likely to be nice back.
- The more people we can bring out of poverty and help make happier, the more productive they can be in society. All of which helps us tackle the big issues like; climate change, colonising other planets and stalling death. Which definitely benefits yourself.

On the flip side, I don't think it's wise to spend all your time helping others. If you gave all your food, money and time to helping others you would starve and have less time and money to spend on improving yourself. And the more you can improve yourself, the more effectively you can help others:

> If you spent 3 out of 10 years learning how to make yourself 200% more effective at helping people. You would help more people in the other 7 years than if you spent 10 years helping people but not learning how to be 200% more effective.

We also work better when we're happy, healthy and motivated. Which means you'll help people in a more effective way. Everyone's a winner.

So don't worry about how much you're helping others. Throughout your life why not try bigger and smaller periods of helping people, and see what you enjoy the most. As long as you're not on either extreme of "never helping others" or "only every helping others and not focusing on yourself", then you're all good. 

NOTE: Would be useful to explain how more selfish and less selfish both benefit others.

The point boils down to:
- Don't worry about how much you're directly helping others
- We need a balance of people with more and less focus on directly helping others. As the indirect people build companies, research new useful things, provide entertainment, contribute to the economy, and improve themselves more etc, and the direct people discover the reality of the problems, actually help individuals etc. We need the mixture to tackle everything
- Just don't be on either extreme
- So try out different place on the scale of directly helping others and see what works for you. But don't worry too much about it, the worlds a great place.
