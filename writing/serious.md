# Don't take life too seriously

- At the end of the day you only get to experience your own life, your own, thoughts, feelings and emotions
- So much is out of your control, can't be predicted
- So much is unknown, origins, death, consciousness
- So enjoy it, don't be a dick, but remember to spend some time on yourself
- At the end of the day, does it really matter? Why care so much about something that makes you sad, empathise to a point that you can help. But realise you can't change everything and make everything better for everyone.
- So have fun, enjoy life, don't worry too much about other peoples suffering if you can't reasonably change it. They and other people are also responsible for their suffering.
- Give to charities and help people where you can but do you really need to go out of your way any more? When the world is already so awesome?

What is the meaning of life? Pretty stupid question with no easy answer. 

I feel that all humans want to increase the number of positive experiences and emotions they feel, whilst decreasing the number of negative ones. Seems pretty obvious. Yet I feel that people aren't always acting to do this.

We only get to experience life once, and through our singular point of view. Sure it's nice to help others, it makes us feel good to do so. Satisfied that we've helped a small part of the human race and not just our own lives.

Does it really matter that 

I don't want any of these things to happen. But if they do, I'll accept it and try to find a way to enjoy myself whilst doing so.

I don't want x to happen.
I don't want y to happen.
I even don't want z to happen.

But you know what? If they do, I'm still going to find ways to enjoy myself. I'm still going to focus on how to have a happy life and share that happiness with others.

I find that a lot of people seem to take things very seriously. And if things don't go their way, it effects them massively. Crazy downward spirals of negative thought, another example.

As far as we know we only have 1 life, we only experience it through our own lens. We can't even be certain of what true reality actually is. So I say, don't take things too seriously. Act to shape the world as you want it to be. But if it all fucks up, so what. Find the joy in the new situation, it's there if you look for it.

If you can see the joy in anything in life you're going to have a fucking good time. And it doesn't mean you'll be making immature life decisions that puts you in worse situations later in life. It's entirely possibly to balance rational decision making with an attitude of having fun all the time. As the Lego movie puts it "Everything is awesome". (Even if that was meant as a ...)
