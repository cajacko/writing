# Don't take life too seriously

- At the end of the day you only get to experience your own life, your own, thoughts, feelings and emotions
- So much is out of your control, can't be predicted
- So much is unknown, origins, death, consciousness
- So enjoy it, don't be a dick, but remember to spend some time on yourself
- At the end of the day, does it really matter? Why care so much about something that makes you sad, empathise to a point that you can help. But realise you can't change everything and make everything better for everyone.
- So have fun, enjoy life, don't worry too much about other peoples suffering if you can't reasonably change it. They and other people are also responsible for their suffering.
- Give to charities and help people where you can but do you really need to go out of your way any more? When the world is already so awesome?
