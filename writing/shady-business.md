# Shady Business

- Someone coming in for an interview at a "Shady Business"
- Prospective recruit is a fantastic spy, and explains all their amazing creds
- Turns out the business is literally shady, all the employees provide shade. 1 person works as a pot plant, another as a set of blinds, last person is the chair?
- Game of the scene is the employer revealing someone else in the room who is providing shade and the recruit gives a spy story that shows they're awesome, but not providing shade
- Link together the key skills listed on the job ad, with being physically shady

There was a knock on the thick oaken door, a confident and resounding rap tap tap.

The man behind the desk looks up, shuffles together the pieces of paper he was perusing and calls out "Please, do come in".

As the door glides open a young man in a fantastic black suite enters. His stare moves around the room, glancing upon the awkwardly shaped tall pot plant in the corner, taking in the individual sections of the large blinds across the window and finalises on the man at the desk. "Tarquin, Tarquin Hemsworth at your service" he says, holding out his perfectly manicured hand.

"Ah yes, the new potential recruit. How exciting! You may call me Hollingswood. Please, do sit." Hollingswood gestures to the plump rouge armchair on the other side of the desk. As Tarquin sits Hollingswood continues "I'm so glad you stumbled across our little advertisement. You have no idea how hard it is to recruit someone here at Shady Business Corp".

"Yes well, I came across your ad whilst escaping.... And when I saw that you were looking for a talented international spy, with key skills in espionage, physical combat and disguises..."
