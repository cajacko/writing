# Shady Business

- Someone coming in for an interview at a "Shady Business"
- Prospective recruit is a fantastic spy, and explains all their amazing creds
- Turns out the business is literally shady, all the employees provide shade. 1 person works as a pot plant, another as a set of blinds etc.
- Game of the scene is the employer revealing someone else in the room who is providing shade and the recruit gives a spy story that shows they're awesome, but not providing shade
