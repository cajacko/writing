# Empathy is for suckers (Title in progress)

Empathy

- the ability to understand and share the feelings of another

Sympathy

- feelings of pity and sorrow for someone else's misfortune
- understanding between people; common feeling

- Empathy can increase your motivation to help, but reduce your capability to help
- Empathy is impossible, we can never experience what someone else is experiencing. So it's more about thinking your closer than others to how they feel

The purpose of sympathy/empathy is

- To motivate yourself to avoid that situations
- To motivate you to help others

You don't have to join someone in the feeling in the moment to be empathetic, but having felt it before can help you recognise the pain and potential solutions.

Knowing what it feels like

You're walking down a delightful country lane surrounded by tall cliffs. When you come across a fellow travelling lying on the ground, pinned down by a large boulder on their chest. Struggling to push it off.

The "Sympathy" approach is to recognise that the traveller is in pain, feel sorry for them and help to push the boulder off their chest. Feeling empathy for them would be like finding another boulder, lie down, place it on yourself and then try and find a solution to remove the boulder from the traveller.

- someone stuck with boulder on chest
- sympathy = realises they are in pain and moving the boulder
- empathy = putting a boulder on your chest then trying to help
- empathy = having had a boulder on your chest int he past, you have a better idea of how to move boulders off your chest
- problem: everyones boulder is different, it's like the boulder being transparent
- empathy helps defined the outline of the boulder on their chest, but can't fill in all the details
- study helps do the same thing
- empathy + sympathy help motivate you to help them
- final points:
  - It's impossible to be fully empathic towards someone, as their boulder is unique. Don't pretend that you can see it
  - If you want to help them then study & ask them
  - Don't seek empathy in negative situations as you'll have to go through that yourself, and you won't be able to help well when you've got the boulder on your chest as well. You'll need to wait until you've figured out how to get it off yourself first, and you may not be able to do that. Depression and anxiety is hard yo.

A doctor doesn't need to know what it feels like to have their appendix removed to know the best way to remove it for someone else. This only works because they've studied something complex that has a well defined solution.

Mental problems don't have as clearly defined solutions. The field is very complex. And most of us haven't studied it as much as a doctor studies for removing an appendix.

So in our day to day life empathy can be useful. As long as it doesn't prevent you from helping.

Maybe the end point here is: Empathy can improve your chances of helping someone, but isn't worth seeking out just to help them. As each individual is too unique for you to be fully empathetic, and sympathy combined with research can work just as well.

Doctors = sympathy + study
