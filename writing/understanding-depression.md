# Selfish Dick or Depressed and Needs Help?

When you see a friend in constant pain and agony, it makes sense for them to act selfishly (NOTE: explain an example, when x is happening it makes sense to do y). Got an xyz, doctors find a light bulb up your butt? Sure. Spend some time focussing on yourself. (NOTE: need to be very delicate with the examples)

(NOTE: reduce use of word "pain")
When we're in pain our mental capacity is largely taken up with dealing with that pain. The problem is when this pain is invisible to everyone else. If we don't know you're in pain, we may only see you acting more selfishly and conclude that you're just turning into a dick. (NOTE: Stress this problem more, as this is the crux of why it's important to change our behaviour)

This is a problem when it comes to anxiety and depression. You could be in a whole world of pain, when your thoughts are causing you pain, it makes sense to act for yourself first. (NOTE: Example)

So when you notice someone acting more selfishly than normal for an extended time, maybe you should be more sympathetic and understanding. They could need your help now more than ever. Or maybe they've just got a light bulb stuck up their butt.
