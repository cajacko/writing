# Selfish Dick or Depressed and Needs Help?

When you see a friend in constant pain and agony 😢, it makes sense for them to act more selfishly than usual. If you had a "friend 👀" who had to be rushed to the hospital with a light bulb 💡 up "their" butt 🍑 and spent the next few weeks recovering from painful butt surgery, you'd hope others would give "them" some slack for focussing on "their" current predicament. 

When you're in constant agony it saps so much of your mental capacity 🧠, which makes it hard to deal with anything outside the pain. Most of us realise this, and are great with understanding that your adventurous "friend" needs to focus on themselves for a while. 

But this only works when we know that your "friend" is in pain. When the symptoms of suffering and illness are not present 😐 but your "friend" is acting more selfishly it's easy for us to assume they're just being a dick 🍆.

This is a problem when it comes to anxiety and depression. When you're suffering with either of these you can often be in a whole world 🌍 of pain, pretty much constantly. When your thoughts hurt you, you're going to be hurting a lot. But it's really hard for anyone else to know this. So if you start acting more selfishly than normal, which is totally understandable given the suffering you're facing, but other's don't realise, they may think you're just turning into a dick.

So I just wanted to prompt the friends 👫, loved ones ❤️ and anyone else that when you notice someone acting in a selfish way, give them the benefit of the doubt. You have no idea how much they might be suffering. Give them some slack, listen 👂, be patient and get to know them. Then you'll understand if they are going through something bigger, or are actually just a dick.
