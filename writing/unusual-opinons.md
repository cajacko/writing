# Unusual Opinions I have

Sometimes I think weird things ðŸ¤ª. Here's a whole bunch of the weirder or more controversial opinions I hold and a super rough percentage of how likely I think that statement is to be true or my confidence in that statement (See my post on [thinking in probabilities](https://medium.com/lessons-by-charlie-jackson/how-thinking-in-probabilities-helps-you-make-better-decisions-c82e09bd183a) for more on why that's important). If I've written a post ðŸ“– on the idea or theme of the opinion then I've turned it into a link to that post. Enjoy and remember to tell me why you disagree, I'm sure you'll find some to disagree with ðŸ˜‰.
