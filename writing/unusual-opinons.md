# Unusual Opinions I have

Sometimes I think weird things ðŸ¤ª. Here's a whole bunch of the weirder or more controversial opinions I hold and a super rough percentage of how likely I think that opinion is to be true (See my post on [thinking in probabilities](https://medium.com/lessons-by-charlie-jackson/how-thinking-in-probabilities-helps-you-make-better-decisions-c82e09bd183a) for more on why that's important). If I've written a post ðŸ“– on the idea or theme of the opinion then I've turned it into a link to that post. Enjoy and remember to tell me why you disagree, I'm sure you'll find some to disagree with ðŸ˜‰.

My opinions and confidence in them change all the time. This list was last accurate(ish) as of the 19th April 2020.

TODO: Go through each an have a good think about the probability first. Don't spend too long.

- 90% - Religion does more long term harm for humanity than good.
- 99.9999% - Religion is obviously false
- 50% - At the moment it would be better for humanity to have a max cap on how much you can earn (somewhere between Â£50,000-Â£100,000 per person), everything above can be tax.
- People who earn over (roughly) Â£50,000 should pay much much more tax.
- More money and focus should be spent on trying to live forever.
- Privacy is silly unless it'd specifically related to preventing criminal activity.
- It's better to save an 18 year old than a 1 year old (in the impossible event that you can only pick 1)
- Abortion is fine at any point before birth
- It's good to over compensate (to a degree) when it comes to anti discrimination (TODO: Need to reword this) (NOTE: gender, race, sexuality)
- Coronavirus will overall be a positive event for humanity
- People in the armed forces or olympics don't deserve more respect than Joe in accounting who does nothing of note in his life.
- Self development should be part of the national curriculum
- Nothing really matters so enjoy your life
- Companies do more good for the world than governments
- In general everything keeps getting better
